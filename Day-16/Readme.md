# 🚀 Day 16: Introduction to Deep Learning — Comprehensive Overview

## 1️⃣ What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple hidden layers to learn patterns in data.

**✅ Key points:**

Learns hierarchical feature representations directly from raw data (no need for manual feature engineering).

Especially effective for unstructured data: images, audio, text, video.

Scales well with big data and high-performance hardware (e.g., GPUs).

## 2️⃣ Relationship Between AI, ML, and DL

| Field                            | Description                                         | Example Algorithms                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | Building machines that can mimic human intelligence | Rule-based systems, robotics       |
| **Machine Learning (ML)**        | Subset of AI that learns patterns from data         | Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest |
| **Deep Learning (DL)**           | Subset of ML using multi-layer neural networks      | CNNs, RNNs, Transformers           |

## 3️⃣ Historical Milestones

- 1940s-50s: McCulloch-Pitts neuron, Hebbian learning.
- 1980s: Backpropagation popularized for multi-layer networks.
- 1990s: Shift to SVMs and other ML due to compute/data limitations.
- 2006: Breakthroughs in unsupervised pretraining → coined “Deep Learning”.
- 2012: AlexNet wins ImageNet — revival of DL via GPUs, large datasets.

## 4️⃣ Core Components of a Neural Network

A. Artificial Neuron (Perceptron)
Formula:

**output=σ(∑wixi+b)**

Where:

- 𝑥𝑖= inputs

- 𝑤𝑖= weights

- 𝑏= bias

- 𝜎= activation function
