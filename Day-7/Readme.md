# ðŸ“… Day 7 Log â€“ Data Visualization with Seaborn

**ðŸ§  Learning Objective**

The primary goal for Day 7 was to deepen my understanding of statistical data visualization using Seaborn, building upon the foundational skills learned with Matplotlib. I learned how to:

Visualize distributions, relationships, and categorical data.

Work with Pandas DataFrames seamlessly in Seaborn.

Customize themes, color palettes, and figure aesthetics for presentation-ready charts.

## ðŸ“˜ What is Seaborn?

Seaborn is a high-level Python library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a simplified syntax for complex statistical plots and integrates perfectly with Pandas DataFrames, making it ideal for data analysis.

**ðŸ”‘ Highlights:**

- Fewer lines of code for more attractive plots.

- Built-in color palettes and themes.

- Great for statistical visualizations (e.g., boxplots, heatmaps, KDEs).
